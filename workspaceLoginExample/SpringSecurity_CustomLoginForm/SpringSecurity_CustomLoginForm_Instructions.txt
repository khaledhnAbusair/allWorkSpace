Spring Security Part 3
"Custom Login Form"
"Quick look at the previous project with default login form"

Steps:
1. Create custom jsp page for login
	- So these names need to be as it is:
		j_spring_security_check
		j_username
		j_password
	- form needs to be POST
	- Let's put the error message under the form
2. Configure form-login in security xml file
	- The goal is to go back to login form and display the error message
	- Let's exclude login url in the secured resources
3. Create a LoginController class
4. Test
	- Now we are seeing the new login page

That's it!!! You can provide more configurations in Spring Security.
