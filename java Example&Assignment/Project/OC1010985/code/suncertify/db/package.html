Contains Framework and API to access database files data and structure localy
or remotly.<p>
{@link suncertify.db.Engine} defines the interface for an engine managing the
access to a database file localted in same JVM file system or a reference for a
remote database file engine resides in another JVM. An engine provides the
access to a database file data (local or remote) through
{@link suncertify.db.Session}s.<br>
An {@link suncertify.db.EngineService} defines a factory for creating: database
engines for managing the access for a local database file, remote database file
engines references in another JVM, and network services for exposing a database
engine functionallity to other JVMs. An implementation can be located using
{@link suncertify.db.EngineServiceLoader} which uses java
<code>java.util.ServiceLoader</code>
to load <code>EngineService</code> implementation from classpath.<br>
Below shows an example for creating a database engine, get database record
structure configuration, and reading from a database file data:<br>
<pre>
<code>
    // loads service implementation from classpath
    EngineService service = EngineServiceLoader.locateEngineService();
    File dbFile = new File("....");// path to database file
    // gets/creates and engine for database file
    Engine engine = service.getEngine(dbFile);
    // get database file record structure descriptor.
    Schema schema = engine.getDBSchema();
    // obtain a new session, unique access to database file
    Session session = engine.newSession();
    // get the access to database records
    DBMain dbMain = session.getDataAccess();
    // read a record
    dbMain.read(0);
</code>
</pre>
The same code is used to access a remote database file except construction for
engine will be by calling:
<pre>
<code>
    // pass the host name in which the engine is running, the port, and the
    // unique name assigned to remote engine.
    Engine engine = service.getEngine("somehost",1521,"database");
</code>
</pre>
Other ways can be used to instant the implementation for
{@link suncertify.db.Engine} than using {@link suncertify.db.EngineService}
interface.
